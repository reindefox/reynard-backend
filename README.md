# Reynard Discord Bot 

Unfinished, unreleased and deprecated as it hasn't been developed since 2021.

Most of the functions worked perfectly and were tested many times in the past, but some of them haven't even been finished or tested, so their functioning cannot be guaranteed.\
This bot also had a website control panel, which is might not be opened at this time, but the backend part to interact with it is in the project.

Why is the project not finished? It was just an experience in JS / TS development for me as well as building project architecture in such programming languages and frontend development when making control panel for it.\
There was no aim in creating something public that people will use, but if anyone takes sources for educational purposes - you are welcome.
